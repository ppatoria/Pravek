* Multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers, ignoring the decimal points: 13 √ó 31 = 403.
* Count the total number of decimal places in both factors: 1.3 has 1 decimal place, and 3.1 has 1 decimal place, making a total of 2 decimal places.
* Place the decimal point in the product, starting from the right end and moving 2 places to the left: 403 becomes 4.03.

Therefore, the value of 1.3 √ó 3.1 is **4.03**.

### Q.2
**Question:** The number of angles formed, when two lines intersect, is
**Solution:**
When two lines intersect, they form four angles around the point of intersection. These angles are created by the two lines dividing the plane into four quadrants.

Therefore, the number of angles formed is **4**.

### Q.3
**Question:** What is the product of the largest and the smallest fraction from the following list?
[9\11 ,3\11, 7\11, 5\11, 10\11, 6\11]
**Solution:**
* First, identify the largest and smallest fractions. Since all fractions have the same denominator, we can compare their numerators. The largest numerator is 10, and the smallest numerator is 3.
* So, the largest fraction is (10\11) and the smallest fraction is (3\11).
* Now, multiply the two fractions: (10/11 times 3/11 = 10 times 3/11 times 11 = 30/121).

Therefore, the product of the largest and the smallest fraction is 30/121.

### Q.4
**Question:** The solution of the equation \(3x+4=25\) is
**Solution:**
* To solve the equation, we need to isolate the variable, x.
* Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: \(3x+4-4=25-4\)
* This simplifies to \(3x=21\).
* Divide both sides by 3: (3x/3=21/3)
* This simplifies to \(x=7\).

Therefore, the solution of the equation is **7**.

### Q.5
**Question:** Find the fraction of 3 km to 300 m.
**Solution:**
* First, convert both measurements to the same unit. Since 1 km is equal to 1000 m, 3 km is equal to 3000 m.
* Now, write the fraction: 3000\300
* Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 300: (3000\300)\(300\300) = (10\1)

Therefore, the fraction of 3 km to 300 m is **10\1** or simply **10**.

### Q.6
**Question:** -5+9+(-5)+(-10)+(7) is equal to

  * \(-1+(-10)=-11\)
  * \(-11+7=-4\)

Therefore, \(-5+9+(-5)+(-10)+(7)\) is equal to **-10**.
## Solutions to the Math Exam Questions (Section B)

### Q.7
**Question:** In the adjoining figure, if AB = PQ and BC = CQ, then find the measure of angle CPQ.
**Solution:**
* Given that AB = PQ and BC = CQ, we can conclude that triangles ABC and PQC are congruent by the Side-Side-Side (SSS) congruence criterion.
* Since corresponding angles of congruent triangles are equal, angle CPQ is equal to angle ABC.
* From the figure, angle ABC appears to be a right angle, which is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of angle CPQ is **90 degrees**.

### Q.8
**Question:** Mean of 11, 10, 12, 12, 9, 10, 14, 12, 9 is
**Solution:**
* To find the mean, add all the numbers and divide by the total number of numbers.
* Sum of the numbers: 11 + 10 + 12 + 12 + 9 + 10 + 14 + 12 + 9 = 99
* Number of numbers: 9
* Mean: 99 / 9 = 11

Therefore, the mean of the given numbers is **12.11**.

### Q.9
**Question:** An expression remains the same, when the expressions on the left and on the right are interchanged.
**Solution:**
* An equation is a mathematical statement that shows that two expressions are equal.
* When the expressions on the left and right of an equation are interchanged, the equation remains true.

An **equation** is a statement that asserts the equality of two expressions. For instance, consider the equation:
3 + 4 = 7

If we interchange the expressions on the left and right sides of the equation, we get:
7 = 3 + 4

Both forms of the equation are true because they represent the same relationship. The equality holds regardless of the order of the expressions.

Here's another example:
2x + 5 = 11

If we solve for \(x\), we get:
2x = 11 - 5
2x = 6
x = 3

Now, if we interchange the left and right sides of the original equation, we get:
11 = 2x + 5

This is still true when \(x = 3\):
11 = 2(3) + 5
11 = 6 + 5
11 = 11

So, the equation remains valid even when the expressions on the left and right are swapped.

Therefore, the answer is **Equation**.

### Q.10
**Question:** Number of acute angles in the following figure is
**Solution:**
* An acute angle is an angle that measures less than 90 degrees.
* From the figure  all angles appear to be less than 90 degrees.
* Count the angles: 1, 2, 3

Therefore, the number of acute angles is **3**.

### Q.11

![Figure 11](../maths11.png)

In the given image, we have a right triangle with one of the angles labeled as 125‚àò  (an exterior angle**, another angle as x, and a right angle 90‚àò inside the triangle.

**Step 1: Use the Exterior Angle Property***
The exterior angle property of a triangle states that the exterior angle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. In this case, the exterior angle is
125‚àò  and the two non-adjacent interior angles are x and 90‚àò .
Thus, using the exterior angle property: 
```
125‚àò = x + 90‚àò
```

**Step 2: Solve for x**
```
ùë•=125‚àò‚àí90‚àò
ùë•=35‚àò
```

**Step 3: State the Property Used**
The property used is the exterior angle property of a triangle, which states that the exterior angle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.

**Final Answer**
The value of **ùë•=35‚àò**, and the property used is the exterior angle property.

#### exterior angle property.
**Definition** :
The **exterior angle** of a triangle is formed when one side of the triangle is extended.
The angle formed outside the triangle, adjacent to the vertex of the triangle, is the exterior angle.

For any triangle, the exterior angle is equal to the sum of the two **non-adjacent interior angles** (the angles that are not adjacent to the exterior angle).

![Exterior Angle](./exterior-angle.png)

```
We can verify the exterior angle theorem with the known properties of a triangle. Consider a Œî ABC.

The three angles a + b + c = 180 (angle sum property of a triangle) ----- Equation 1

c= 180 - (a+b) ----- Equation 2 (rewriting equation 1)

e = 180 - c----- Equation 3 (linear pair of angles)

Substituting the value of c in equation 3, we get

e = 180 - [180 - (a + b)]

e = 180 - 180 + (a + b)

e = a + b

Hence verified.
```

### Q.12
**Question:** If 28 trousers of equal size can be made from 63 m of cloth, what length of cloth is required for one trouser?

Therefore, the length of cloth required for one trouser is **2.25 meters**.

### Q.13
**Question:** Calculate the mean of the first five prime numbers.
**Solution:**
* The first five prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.
* Sum of the numbers: 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 = 28
* Number of numbers: 5
* Mean: 28 / 5 = 5.6

Therefore, the mean of the first five prime numbers is **5.6**.

### Q.14
**Question:** If (2x-1)/3=(x+2)/2, then what is the value of x?
**Solution:**
To solve the equation:
```
(2x - 1) / 3 = (x + 2) / 2
```
**Step 1: Eliminate the denominators by multiplying both sides by 6**  (the least common multiple of 3 and 2):

```
6 * [(2x - 1) / 3] = 6 *  [(x + 2) / 2]
```

This simplifies to:

```
2(2x - 1) = 3(x + 2)
```

**Step 2: Expand both sides**:

```
4x - 2 = 3x + 6
```

**Step 3: Bring all the terms with \(x\) on one side and constants on the other side**:

```
4x - 3x = 6 + 2
```

This simplifies to:

```
x = 8
```

Therefore, the value of x is **8**.

To find the **median**, we need to determine the middle value in this ordered data.

- The total number of observations is 21 (an odd number).
- The middle value is the \((21+1)/2 = 11\)th value.

So, the 11th value in the ordered list is **46**.

Thus, the **median** is **46**.

**Mode Calculation:**

The **mode** is the number that appears most frequently in the data set.

In the ordered list:
- 12 appears **3 times**.
- 34 appears **2 times**.

The most frequent value is **12**.

Thus, the **mode** is **12**. 

**Final Answer:**
- **Median** = 46
- **Mode** = 12

### Q.16
**Question:** Raju owns a plot which is 1 1/3 acre in size. If the value of land in his area is ‚Çπ48,000 per acre, what is the value of his plot?
**Solution:**
To calculate the value of Raju's plot, you can follow these steps:

1. **Convert 1 1/3 acres to a decimal:**
   - 1 1/3 acres = 1 + 1/3 = 1.3333 acres.

2. **Multiply the plot size by the value per acre:**
   Value of the plot = 1.3333 acres * 48,000‚Çπ/acre
   Value of the plot= 64,000 ‚Çπ

So, the value of Raju's plot is ‚Çπ64,000.



### Q.17
**Question:** In a family, the consumption of wheat is 4 times that of rice. The total consumption of the two cereals is 80 kg. Find the quantities of rice and wheat consumed in the family.
**Solution:**

### Q.18
**Question:** The given data is arranged in ascending order. The sum of mode and median of the given data is 15. Find the value of y.
y-1, y-1, y+1, y+4, 2y+1, 3y, 4y
**Solution:**

Let's break this down step by step.

Given Data in Ascending Order:
[ y-1,  y-1,  y+1,  y+4,  2y+1,  3y,  4y ]

We are asked to find the value of \( y \), given that the sum of the mode and the median is 15.

---

**Step 1: Find the Mode**
- The **mode** is the value that appears most frequently in the data set.
- In the given data, ( y-1 ) appears twice, while all other values appear only once.
- So, the mode is ( y-1 ).

---

**Step 2: Find the Median**
- The **median** is the middle value in an ordered data set.
- Since there are 7 numbers, the median will be the 4th number in the ordered set.

So, the median is ( y+4 ).

---

**Step 3: Equation Setup**
We are told that the sum of the mode and the median is 15. So, we can set up the equation as:
Mode + Median = 15
(y-1) + (y+4) = 15

Step 4: Solve for \( y \)
Simplify the equation:
2y + 3 = 15
Subtract 3 from both sides:
2y = 12
Divide by 2:
y = 6

---

**Final Answer:**
The value of ( y ) is **6**.

**Question:** In the given adjacent figure, ‚ñ≥QPR is a right-angled triangle with angle QPR = 70¬∞.
* i) Find the value of y
* ii) Find the value of x
* iii) Find the value of z
**Solution:**
* **i) Angle QPR = 70¬∞**, so angle PQR = 90¬∞ - 70¬∞ = 20¬∞ (since it's a right-angled triangle).
* **ii) Angle QPR = 20¬∞**, so angle PRQ = 180¬∞ - 70¬∞ - 20¬∞ = 90¬∞ (sum of angles in a triangle is 180¬∞).
* **iii) Angle PRQ = 90¬∞**, so triangle PQR is a right-angled triangle. Therefore, x = PR = PQ = y (since it's an isosceles right-angled triangle).

Therefore, the values are:
* **y = x**
* **x = PR = PQ**
* **z = 90¬∞**

### Q.20
**Question:** A square and an equilateral triangle have a side in common. If the side of the triangle is \(\frac{4}{3}\) cm long, find the perimeter of the adjacent figure.
**Solution:**
* Since the side of the triangle is \(\frac{4}{3}\) cm, the side of the square is also \(\frac{4}{3}\) cm.
* Perimeter of the square: 4 * \(\frac{4}{3}\) = \(\frac{16}{3}\) cm
* Perimeter of the equilateral triangle: 3 * \(\frac{4}{3}\) = 4 cm
* Total perimeter: \(\frac{16}{3}\) + 4 = \(\frac{28}{3}\) cm

Therefore, the perimeter of the adjacent figure is **\(\frac{28}{3}\) cm**.
