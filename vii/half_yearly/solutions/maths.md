## Solutions to the Math Exam Questions

### Q.1
**Question:** The value of 1.3 × 3.1 is
**Solution:**
* Multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers, ignoring the decimal points: 13 × 31 = 403.
* Count the total number of decimal places in both factors: 1.3 has 1 decimal place, and 3.1 has 1 decimal place, making a total of 2 decimal places.
* Place the decimal point in the product, starting from the right end and moving 2 places to the left: 403 becomes 4.03.

Therefore, the value of 1.3 × 3.1 is **4.03**.

### Q.2
**Question:** The number of angles formed, when two lines intersect, is
**Solution:**
When two lines intersect, they form four angles around the point of intersection. These angles are created by the two lines dividing the plane into four quadrants.

Therefore, the number of angles formed is **4**.

### Q.3
**Question:** What is the product of the largest and the smallest fraction from the following list?
\[\frac{9}{11},\frac{3}{11},\frac{7}{11},\frac{5}{11},\frac{10}{11},\frac{6}{11}\]
**Solution:**
* First, identify the largest and smallest fractions. Since all fractions have the same denominator, we can compare their numerators. The largest numerator is 10, and the smallest numerator is 3.
* So, the largest fraction is \(\frac{10}{11}\) and the smallest fraction is \(\frac{3}{11}\).
* Now, multiply the two fractions: \(\frac{10}{11} \times \frac{3}{11} = \frac{10 \times 3}{11 \times 11} = \frac{30}{121}\).

Therefore, the product of the largest and the smallest fraction is **\(\frac{30}{121}\)**.

### Q.4
**Question:** The solution of the equation \(3x+4=25\) is
**Solution:**
* To solve the equation, we need to isolate the variable, x.
* Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: \(3x+4-4=25-4\)
* This simplifies to \(3x=21\).
* Divide both sides by 3: \(\frac{3x}{3}=\frac{21}{3}\)
* This simplifies to \(x=7\).

Therefore, the solution of the equation is **7**.

### Q.5
**Question:** Find the fraction of 3 km to 300 m.
**Solution:**
* First, convert both measurements to the same unit. Since 1 km is equal to 1000 m, 3 km is equal to 3000 m.
* Now, write the fraction: \(\frac{3000}{300}\)
* Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 300: \(\frac{3000 \div 300}{300 \div 300} = \frac{10}{1}\)

Therefore, the fraction of 3 km to 300 m is **\(\frac{10}{1}\)** or simply **10**.

### Q.6
**Question:** \(-5+9+(-5)+(-10)+(7)\) is equal to
**Solution:**
* Combine the numbers:
  * \(-5+9=4\)
  * \(4+(-5)=-1\)
  * \(-1+(-10)=-11\)
  * \(-11+7=-4\)

Therefore, \(-5+9+(-5)+(-10)+(7)\) is equal to **-4**.
