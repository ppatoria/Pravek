When two lines intersect, they form four angles around the point of intersection. These angles are created by the two lines dividing the plane into four quadrants.

Therefore, the number of angles formed is **4**.

### Q.3
**Question:** What is the product of the largest and the smallest fraction from the following list?
[9\11 ,3\11, 7\11, 5\11, 10\11, 6\11]
**Solution:**
* First, identify the largest and smallest fractions. Since all fractions have the same denominator, we can compare their numerators. The largest numerator is 10, and the smallest numerator is 3.
* So, the largest fraction is (10\11) and the smallest fraction is (3\11).
* Now, multiply the two fractions: (10/11 times 3/11 = 10 times 3/11 times 11 = 30/121).

Therefore, the product of the largest and the smallest fraction is 30/121.

### Q.4
**Question:** The solution of the equation \(3x+4=25\) is
**Solution:**
* To solve the equation, we need to isolate the variable, x.
* Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: \(3x+4-4=25-4\)
* This simplifies to \(3x=21\).
* Divide both sides by 3: (3x/3=21/3)
* This simplifies to \(x=7\).

Therefore, the solution of the equation is **7**.

### Q.5
**Question:** Find the fraction of 3 km to 300 m.
**Solution:**
* First, convert both measurements to the same unit. Since 1 km is equal to 1000 m, 3 km is equal to 3000 m.
* Now, write the fraction: 3000\300
* Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 300: (3000\300)\(300\300) = (10\1)

Therefore, the fraction of 3 km to 300 m is **10\1** or simply **10**.

### Q.6
**Question:** -5+9+(-5)+(-10)+(7) is equal to
**Solution:**
* Combine the numbers:
  * \(-5+9=4\)
  * \(4+(-5)=-1\)
  * \(-1+(-10)=-11\)
  * \(-11+7=-4\)

Therefore, \(-5+9+(-5)+(-10)+(7)\) is equal to **-10**.

### Q.7
**Question:** In the adjoining figure, if AB = PQ and BC = CQ, then find the measure of angle CPQ.
**Solution:**
* Given that AB = PQ and BC = CQ, we can conclude that triangles ABC and PQC are congruent by the Side-Side-Side (SSS) congruence criterion.
* Since corresponding angles of congruent triangles are equal, angle CPQ is equal to angle ABC.
* From the figure, angle ABC appears to be a right angle, which is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of angle CPQ is **90 degrees**.

### Q.8
**Question:** Mean of 11, 10, 12, 12, 9, 10, 14, 12, 9 is
**Solution:**
* To find the mean, add all the numbers and divide by the total number of numbers.
* Sum of the numbers: 11 + 10 + 12 + 12 + 9 + 10 + 14 + 12 + 9 = 99
* Number of numbers: 9
* Mean: 99 / 9 = 11

Therefore, the mean of the given numbers is **12.11**.

### Q.9
**Question:** An expression remains the same, when the expressions on the left and on the right are interchanged.
**Solution:**
* An equation is a mathematical statement that shows that two expressions are equal.
* When the expressions on the left and right of an equation are interchanged, the equation remains true.

An **equation** is a statement that asserts the equality of two expressions. For instance, consider the equation:
3 + 4 = 7

If we interchange the expressions on the left and right sides of the equation, we get:
7 = 3 + 4

Both forms of the equation are true because they represent the same relationship. The equality holds regardless of the order of the expressions.

Here's another example:
2x + 5 = 11

If we solve for \(x\), we get:
2x = 11 - 5
2x = 6
x = 3

Now, if we interchange the left and right sides of the original equation, we get:
11 = 2x + 5

This is still true when \(x = 3\):
11 = 2(3) + 5
11 = 6 + 5
11 = 11

So, the equation remains valid even when the expressions on the left and right are swapped.

Therefore, the answer is **Equation**.

### Q.10
**Question:** Number of acute angles in the following figure is
**Solution:**
* An acute angle is an angle that measures less than 90 degrees.
* From the figure  all angles appear to be less than 90 degrees.
* Count the angles: 1, 2, 3

Therefore, the number of acute angles is **3**.

### Q.11

![Figure 11](./maths11.png)

### Given Figure
In the given image, we have a right triangle with:
- One of the angles labeled as \(125^\circ\) (an exterior angle)
- Another angle as \(x\)
- A right angle (\(90^\circ\)) inside the triangle.

### Step 1: Use the Exterior Angle Property
The **exterior angle property** of a triangle states that the exterior angle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. In this case, the exterior angle is \(125^\circ\) and the two non-adjacent interior angles are \(x\) and \(90^\circ\).

Thus, using the exterior angle property:

\[
125^\circ = x + 90^\circ
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \(x\)

\[
x = 125^\circ - 90^\circ
\]
\[
x = 35^\circ
\]

### Step 3: State the Property Used
The property used is the **exterior angle property** of a triangle, which states that the exterior angle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.

### Final Answer
The value of \(x = 35^\circ\), and the property used is the **exterior angle property**.

### Q.12
**Question:** If 28 trousers of equal size can be made from 63 m of cloth, what length of cloth is required for one trouser?

Therefore, the length of cloth required for one trouser is **2.25 meters**.

### Q.13
**Question:** Calculate the mean of the first five prime numbers.
**Solution:**
* The first five prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.
* Sum of the numbers: 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 = 28
* Number of numbers: 5
* Mean: 28 / 5 = 5.6

Therefore, the mean of the first five prime numbers is **5.6**.

### Q.14
**Question:** If 2x-1=x+2, then what is the value of x?
**Solution:**
* To solve the equation, isolate the variable x.
* Subtract x from both sides: 2x - 1 - x = x + 2 - x
* Simplify: x - 1 = 2
* Add 1 to both sides: x - 1 + 1 = 2 + 1
* Simplify: x = 3

Therefore, the value of x is **3**.

* **Mode:** The mode is the number that appears most frequently. In this data, 12 appears three times, which is more than any other number.

Therefore, the median is **45.5** and the mode is **12**.

### Q.16
**Question:** Raju owns a plot which is 1 acre in size. If the value of land in his area is ₹48,000 per acre, what is the value of his plot?
**Solution:**
* Multiply the size of the plot by the value per acre: 1 acre × ₹48,000/acre = ₹48,000

Therefore, the value of Raju's plot is **₹48,000**.

### Q.17
**Question:** In a family, the consumption of wheat is 4 times that of rice. The total consumption of the two cereals is 80 kg. Find the quantities of rice and wheat consumed in the family.
**Solution:**
* Let the consumption of rice be x kg.
* Then, the consumption of wheat is 4x kg.
* Total consumption: x + 4x = 5x kg
* Given that total consumption is 80 kg: 5x = 80
* Solving for x: x = 16
* So, consumption of rice is 16 kg and consumption of wheat is 4 * 16 = 64 kg.

Therefore, the family consumed **16 kg of rice** and **64 kg of wheat**.

### Q.18
**Question:** The given data is arranged in ascending order. The sum of mode and median of the given data is 15. Find the value of y.
\(y-1, y-1, y+1, y+4, 2y+1, 3y, 4y\)
**Solution:**
* **Median:** Since there are 7 terms, the median is the middle term, which is \(y+1\).
* **Mode:** The mode is the value that appears most frequently. In this case, \(y-1\) appears twice, more than any other value.
* **Equation:** Median + Mode = 15
* Substitute the values: \(y+1 + (y-1) = 15\)
* Simplify: \(2y = 15\)
* Divide by 2: \(y = 7.5\)

Therefore, the value of y is **7.5**.

* i) Find the value of y
* ii) Find the value of x
* iii) Find the value of z
**Solution:**
* **i) Angle QPR = 70°**, so angle PQR = 90° - 70° = 20° (since it's a right-angled triangle).
* **ii) Angle QPR = 20°**, so angle PRQ = 180° - 70° - 20° = 90° (sum of angles in a triangle is 180°).
* **iii) Angle PRQ = 90°**, so triangle PQR is a right-angled triangle. Therefore, x = PR = PQ = y (since it's an isosceles right-angled triangle).

Therefore, the values are:
* **y = x**
* **x = PR = PQ**
* **z = 90°**

### Q.20
**Question:** A square and an equilateral triangle have a side in common. If the side of the triangle is \(\frac{4}{3}\) cm long, find the perimeter of the adjacent figure.
**Solution:**
* Since the side of the triangle is \(\frac{4}{3}\) cm, the side of the square is also \(\frac{4}{3}\) cm.
* Perimeter of the square: 4 * \(\frac{4}{3}\) = \(\frac{16}{3}\) cm
* Perimeter of the equilateral triangle: 3 * \(\frac{4}{3}\) = 4 cm
* Total perimeter: \(\frac{16}{3}\) + 4 = \(\frac{28}{3}\) cm

Therefore, the perimeter of the adjacent figure is **\(\frac{28}{3}\) cm**.
