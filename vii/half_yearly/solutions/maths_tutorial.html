<p>To create a tutorial covering all the key topics from the provided
answer sheet, I’ll break down the concepts according to a logical flow
rather than the sequence in the document. The tutorial will be concise
and focused on the main concepts while drawing from the examples in the
document.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="triangles-and-angles">1. <strong>Triangles and
Angles</strong></h2>
<h3 id="interior-and-exterior-angles-in-triangles"><strong>Interior and
Exterior Angles in Triangles</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interior Angles</strong>: The sum of the interior angles in
any triangle is always (180^).
<ul>
<li>Example: In triangle QPR, with angles (QRP = 90^) and (QPR = 70^),
the third angle is calculated as: [ = 180^- (90^+ 70^) = 20^ ]</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Exterior Angle Theorem</strong>: An exterior angle is equal
to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
<ul>
<li>Example: The exterior angle (x) at vertex (T) is calculated as (90^+
70^= 160^).</li>
<li>The corresponding angle on a straight line would be (z = 180^- 160^=
20^).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="congruence-of-triangles"><strong>Congruence of
Triangles</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Two triangles are congruent if all corresponding sides and angles
are equal (SSS, SAS, etc.).
<ul>
<li>Example: Triangles ABC and PQC are congruent by the Side-Side-Side
(SSS) criterion, so corresponding angles like ( CPQ ) are equal to (90^)
.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-pythagorean-theorem">2. <strong>The Pythagorean
Theorem</strong></h2>
<p>The Pythagorean theorem applies to right-angled triangles, stating
that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of
the other two sides: [ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 ] - <strong>Example</strong>: A
tree broken 5 m above the ground touches the ground 12 m from its base.
Using the theorem, the original height of the tree can be calculated: [
5^2 + 12^2 = c^2 c = = 13 , ] Therefore, the total height is (5 + 13 =
18 , ) .</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="perimeter-and-area-of-geometric-shapes">3. <strong>Perimeter and
Area of Geometric Shapes</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perimeter of Polygons</strong>: The perimeter is the total
length of all sides of a shape.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: For a square and an equilateral triangle
sharing one side, where each side of the triangle is ( , ), the
perimeter of the combined figure can be found by summing the sides,
considering the shared side .</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="statistics">4. <strong>Statistics</strong></h2>
<h3 id="mean-median-and-mode"><strong>Mean, Median, and
Mode</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mean</strong>: The average of a set of numbers.
<ul>
<li>Example: Mean of (11, 10, 12, 12, 9, 10, 14, 12, 9): [ = = 11 ]</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Median</strong>: The middle value in an ordered dataset.
<ul>
<li>Example: In a dataset of 21 values, the 11th value is the
median.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mode</strong>: The value that appears most frequently.
<ul>
<li>Example: In a dataset where (12) appears three times, the mode is
(12) .</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="solving-linear-equations">5. <strong>Solving Linear
Equations</strong></h2>
<p>Linear equations are algebraic expressions that represent a straight
line when plotted on a graph. They are solved by isolating the variable.
- <strong>Example 1</strong>: Solving for (Raju’s) age: [ 3x + 5 = 44 x
= = 13 ] - <strong>Example 2</strong>: Solving for a number (x) such
that (x = 10): [ x = 10 = 40 ] 【12†source】.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="geometrical-properties-of-shapes">6. <strong>Geometrical
Properties of Shapes</strong></h2>
<h3 id="medians-in-a-triangle"><strong>Medians in a
Triangle</strong></h3>
<p>A median connects a vertex of a triangle to the midpoint of the
opposite side, dividing the side into two equal parts. -
<strong>Example</strong>: For a triangle with medians (EV, FK, GS), the
lengths can be found by dividing the corresponding sides into two equal
parts .</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="special-cases-profit-and-loss">7. <strong>Special Cases: Profit
and Loss</strong></h2>
<p>Profit and loss problems can be solved by simple arithmetic,
adjusting for total profit/loss over a period. -
<strong>Example</strong>: A shopkeeper earns ₹1 per pen and loses 40
paise per pencil. After selling 45 pens and incurring a ₹5 loss, the
number of pencils sold can be found through equation setup .</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This tutorial covered key mathematical concepts, including geometry,
algebra, and statistics, with examples to illustrate each point. These
topics are fundamental for solving a wide range of mathematical problems
effectively.</p>
